#### **IMPORTANT: when the plugin is updated, you must delete the GuiBuilder folder under game.ReplicatedStorage if you wish to use the updated GuiActionInfo module. If you have custom GuiActions written in the GuiActionInfo module, make sure to either copy them or have them stored somewhere else before you delete and update!**

# Introduction 

GuiBuilder is a Roblox static gui development plugin that allows predefined "GuiActions" to be assigned to input events of gui elements.

## Design goals:

- Tie together the Gui programming and design processes 
- Allow for easy creation of new GuiActions
- Allow for robust integration of Roblox's input objects

# The GuiBuilder interface

The GuiBuilder editor menu can be opened with the toolbar button labeled "Editor." Once the editor is open, a desired gui element's input events may be viewed by selecting it:

Clicking on an input event in the input frame (the frame at the top of the editor window) after selecting an element will display the input's assigned GuiActions. If an event has at least one assigned action, its button in the input frame will be highlighted. The element below doesn't have any assigned actions yet:

A new action can be added by clicking on the desired action's "Create" button; this will open the parameter window, where the GuiAction's parameters can be edited. In the following image, a SetBackgroundColor3 action is being assigned to the frame's MouseEnter event:

Once a GuiAction has been created, it will be displayed as a button under the appropriate GuiAction label. Created GuiActions can be edited by simply clicking on this button, which will again open the parameter window.

# Requiring the GuiBuilderClientMain.lua module

ReplicatedStorage.GuiBuilder.GuiBuilderClientMain **must** be required by the client for events to be connected. In a LocalScript on the client:

```
require(game.ReplicatedStorage.GuiBuilder.GuiBuilderClientMain)
```

GuiBuilder inserts this LocalScript automatically; if you would like to load the module yourself, the automatic require can be disabled through the AutoRequire setting in the settings menu.

# Creating custom GuiActions

A GuiAction consists of a name, an arbitrary number of parameters, and a function to be called when the GuiAction's associated input event is fired. GuiActions are defined in ReplicatedStorage.GuiBuilder.GuiActionInfo. The syntax for defining a GuiAction is as follows:

```
GuiActionName = { --declaration of a new GuiAction called "GuiActionName"
  StringParam = "string", --a string parameter called "StringParam"  
  NumberParam = "number" --a number parameter called "NumberParam" 
  InstanceParam = "instance", --an instance parameter called "InstanceParam"  
  ["func"] = function(parameters, passedEventArgumentsArray) --the associated function  
  end
}
```

A GuiAction necessitating an external dependency can `require()` the needed module within its associated function. A freshly edited GuiActionInfo.lua module can be hot-swapped into a running GuiBuilder instance by clicking the "Refresh GuiActions" toolbar button.

# Settings

## AutoRequire (default TRUE)

Sets whether StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.GuiBuilderClient.lua will be automatically generated by GuiBuilder.
